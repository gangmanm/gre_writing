## 초안 

There is no doubt that humans rely heavily upon technology. When you take a subway you can easily see how many peoples are with their phones on their hands. And even in every day work workers use chatGPT to help them with their work. But I disagree with the point that it will decriminalize the human ability to think.

First, It’s always human who’s decide whether to use the result of technology. For example, the marketing manager may use the analysis data made by AI about current market trends. but the ones who makes the final decision how to advertise or find a way to use the trends will be the manager not AI.
like the example above technology like Deep learning or Machine Learning will merely be the product that analyzes data. But the final call should always made by humans. 

Second of all, technology will give us ability to think without limitations. before Elon musks space company Space X. people thought it is impossible that non governmental companies could launch satellites and rockets to space. But surely he showed us with clear proof of everything is possible. with advanced of technology people will improve more by not limited by the hardship of implementing them. For example even person without a single knowledge of coding he or she can easily make a person web site using AI coding assistance like ‘Cursor’. Technologies will definitely broaden our level of thinking not deteriorate.

However, one might insist that too much involvement of technology limits our own ability to think by making decisions for us. like some students using ChatGPT while taking a test. But it is not the fault of technology itself but rather then people ability and decision they make how to use it. and i think if we decide to use technology wisely we can undoubtedly improve our way of thinking without limitations.

## AI 교정 

n the modern world, it is undeniable that people increasingly rely on technology to solve problems in daily life, from navigation systems to artificial intelligence in the workplace. However, the claim that this growing reliance will inevitably diminish our ability to think independently oversimplifies a much more nuanced relationship between humans and technology. On the contrary, when used wisely, technology can expand the boundaries of human thinking rather than deteriorate it.

First and foremost, humans remain the ultimate decision-makers, even when they use technology to support their choices. For example, a marketing manager may utilize AI-generated reports to gain insight into current trends. However, the responsibility to interpret these trends, form a coherent strategy, and make final decisions still rests with the human. Technologies such as deep learning and data analytics are merely tools—they provide information but do not replace judgment. The ability to think critically and make informed decisions remains fundamentally human.

Moreover, technology has empowered people to think beyond traditional limitations and pursue more ambitious goals. Consider the example of SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk. Until recently, space exploration was thought to be the exclusive domain of government institutions. Yet, technological advancements allowed a private company not only to launch rockets but also to pioneer reusable launch systems—an innovation that was once considered science fiction. Similarly, AI coding assistants now enable individuals with little to no programming experience to build functional websites and applications. Rather than hindering our thinking, such tools make creativity and problem-solving more accessible to a wider range of people.

To be sure, there are valid concerns about overreliance on technology. Some students, for instance, use AI tools like ChatGPT to complete assignments or even cheat on exams, raising questions about academic integrity and intellectual laziness. However, these issues stem not from the technology itself, but from how individuals choose to use it. Just as a hammer can build a house or cause harm, technology is neutral until it is wielded by human hands. If we choose to engage with technology responsibly, it can support and even enhance our ability to think.

In conclusion, while the temptation to let machines do our thinking for us may exist, the reality is that technology is most powerful when it complements human intelligence. Far from deteriorating our thinking, it holds the potential to expand it—if we learn to use it wisely.
