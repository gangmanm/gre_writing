## Task Overview

In this task, you will:
- Analyze the logical structure of an argument
- Identify assumptions and flaws

- Write a well-organized critique within 30 minutes

## Key Analysis Components

### 1. Identifying Assumptions

Look for unstated assumptions such as:
- Cause-and-effect relationships
- Representative samples
- Analogous situations
- Temporal relationships
- Definitions of terms

### 2. Evaluating Evidence

Consider the quality of evidence:
- Sample size and selection
- Time frame of data
- Relevance of examples
- Credibility of sources
- Potential biases

### 3. Finding Logical Flaws

Common logical fallacies include:
- Hasty generalizations
- False analogies
- Post hoc reasoning
- Circular arguments
- Appeal to authority

## Essay Structure

### Introduction
- Briefly summarize the argument
- State your main critique points
- Avoid agreeing or disagreeing with the conclusion

### Body Paragraphs
Each paragraph should:
- Focus on one major flaw
- Explain why it's problematic
- Suggest ways to strengthen or evaluate
- Use specific examples from the argument

### Conclusion
- Summarize main points of critique
- Suggest what would make the argument more convincing
- Emphasize the importance of additional evidence

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Taking a Position**
